Initially coded last April 25, 2018. Rechecked for compatability with PHP 8.2 on July 24, 2023

# Simple PHP File Archiver with Comment
This code can compressed multiple files at the same time and write comment inside to send a message 
to whoever opens the archive. Once the zip file is created, the script downloads it then deleted 
the uploaded file(s) and the generated archive from the server to save space.

Tested to work only with WinRAR. Not yet tested with other archiving softwares.

### Installation
